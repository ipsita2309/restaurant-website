## ‚úÖ Enhancements Implemented

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Added **skip to content** link for keyboard users.
- Ensured **color contrast ‚â• 4.5:1**.
- Semantic HTML5 structure (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `footer`).
- Logical heading order (`h1` ‚Üí `h2`).
- Added **focus indicators** (`:focus-visible`) for all links, buttons, and form fields.
- ARIA attributes:
  - `role="navigation"`, `aria-label` on navs.
  - `aria-current="page"` for active link.
  - Labels and `aria-required` on form fields.
- Fully keyboard navigable.

### Responsiveness
- Used **flexbox** and **CSS grid** layouts.
- Mobile-first design with breakpoints for tablet & desktop.
- Pure CSS **hamburger menu** (no JS).
- Responsive images with `srcset` + `sizes`.
- Lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`) for performance.

### Forms
- Accessible labels, required indicators, and focus styles.
- Form redirects to **thankyou.html** (placeholder confirmation).

### Print-Friendly
- Added `@media print` rules:
  - Hides nav, header, footer, skip link, and buttons.
  - Keeps main content clean for printing.
  - Links display their URLs.

### Visual Enhancements
- **CSS-driven icons** for nav links, section headings, and buttons.
- Subtle **icon animations** on hover/focus (scale + color change).
- **Fade-in animation** for page content on load.
- Added `prefers-reduced-motion` support to disable animations for sensitive users.
